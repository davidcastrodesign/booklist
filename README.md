Booklist

Booklist is an exercise from ES5 coverting classes and other Dom manipulation methods to ES6. The app creates a book list by title, author, and number(isbn). User can make a list by submitting the fields above and the book will be added and app will display a book added message on top. If the user clicks submits without any fields filled and error message will show. Data entered stay in local storage(ls), if the user no longer desires the book to be in the list, user must remove the book by clicking on the X next to the book listed. It will be removed from both UI and ls.
