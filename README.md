Booklist

Booklist is an exercise in coverting ES5 classes and other Dom manipulation methods to ES6. The app creates a book list by title, author, and number(isbn). User can make a list by submitting the fields above and the book will be added, the app will promptly display a book added message on top. If the user submits without any fields filled and error message will also. Data entered stays in Local Storage(LS), if the user no longer desires the book to be listed, the user must remove the book by clicking on the X next to the book listed. It will be removed from both UI and LS.
